## Choosing a License

It's very important to choose a license for a project.  If a license is not chosen, then the project must be assumed to be all rights reserved.  A license enables you to decide how users can use and distribute your software.  Without one, they do not have the ability to do anything with your software.

## Can I use a project without an explicit license?
No, you cannot.  Without a license, the software is all rights reserved to the author.  You do not have the ability to do anything with the software.

## The Web vs. Gopher
Not being an expert, I find it hard to agree or disagree, but the author's sentiments appear valid.  In particular, I think that social influences like memetics are the most important factor in Gohper's downfall.  If either of these competing technologies were to fall behind the other, it would make sense that the demise of the less popular technology would come swiftly.  If superior technology made something more popular, we would not have Javascript.

## Linux Licensing
Linux uses the GPL v2 for a simple reason.  As an operating system packed with Gnu, it is required to use the GLP v2 as its license.

## Project Idea / License
An example project is a text editor that has many extensible features.  I would license it under the GNU GPLv3, because I believe that all modifications should be licensed under my license and shared.  For something that is designed to be extensible, it makes sense that many modifications will be useful for many users.  It would be best for the greater good to share these modifications with the public.  This would save future users development time, because they can use existing modifications instead of creating their own.

## Course Project
My project will be a text editor with support for plugins.  These plugins can use the API without needing to modify the core editor's code.  Users will be varied.  Users will not be paying, and will use the text editor however they please.  It will have features for coding, as well as regular text.  It will use the GPL so that any plugins will be shared with the community.
