** Status of project
My project is moving along very slowly to say the least.  I have not worked on any part of it yet.  I'm not too excited about the idea of the project, and wished I had joined another team's, but I'll have to make the most of it.  This week I will start the project by developing the application.  I will probably use C# for the project, as I am most familiar with using .net for developing GUI applications.  Work on licensing and plugins will happen after the basic application is developed in a few weeks.  I expect that by the end of the semester, I will have an idea of how to best license plugins.
