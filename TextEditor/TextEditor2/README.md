This is the location for the V2 remake of the text editor.  Version 1 can be found here: https://github.com/mmetro/TextEditor/tree/master

This application is a basic text editor which demonstrates a proof of concept for a plugin system.  The application has imports which can be satisfied by either external class libraries, or an internal class if no external class libraries are found.  The application currently looks at its plugins to find an export for coloring the text of the editor.
